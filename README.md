## Projects

### **GymDataAnalytics Project**  
**Description:**  
Analyzed a Kaggle dataset of strength-based exercises targeting various muscle groups, including the abdomen, chest, biceps, glutes, and lower back. The objective was to identify the most effective exercises for different fitness goals and understand workout trends.

**Key Highlights:**  
- Cleaned and preprocessed data using **R** and **Python**.  
- Performed correlation analysis (**Pearson correlation**) to explore relationships between exercise attributes and difficulty levels.  
- Developed visualizations such as **pie charts** and **bar graphs** to highlight exercise trends by fitness level.  
- Designed interactive dashboards and **3D visualizations** using **Plotly** for enhanced data exploration.  
- Converted data into **JSON** format for broader accessibility.  
- Presented findings in a research symposium with a designed research poster.

**Tech Stack:**  
`Python`, `R`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly`, `Power BI`, `JSON`, `GitHub`, `Google Colab`

### **Pulse Mortality Metrics Project**  
**Description:**  
Analyzed heart rate and mortality data for individuals aged 35+ across various U.S. states. The project aimed to uncover patterns in mortality rates linked to heart health and provide insights for healthcare strategies.

**Key Highlights:**  
- Analyzed large datasets using **Python** for data exploration and **Hadoop** for distributed processing.  
- Executed **Hadoop commands** and managed **JAR files** for efficient big data workflows.  
- Used **GitHub** for version control, collaboration, and detailed project documentation.  
- Provided actionable insights into healthcare trends that could inform public health policies.

**Tech Stack:**  
`Python`, `Hadoop`, `GitHub`, `Git Bash`, `Google Colab`

### **Spotify Top Songs Project**  
**Description:**  
Analyzed Spotify's top songs dataset to uncover trends in song popularity and listener preferences. The analysis focused on identifying key factors influencing chart performance.

**Key Highlights:**  
- Explored features like **tempo**, **danceability**, and **artist collaborations**.  
- Created clear and engaging visualizations using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Pandas**.  
- Investigated the impact of **record labels** and collaborations on track success.  
- Developed **interactive visualizations** to reveal patterns in music consumption.  
- Processed and analyzed data efficiently on **Google Colab**.

**Tech Stack:**  
`Python`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly`, `Google Colab`, `GitHub`
